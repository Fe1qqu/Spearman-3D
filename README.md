# 🔥 Spearman 3D

**Spearman 3D** is my reimagined version of the classic game [Spearman](https://github.com/SurXD/Spearman),  
originally written in **C++ using graphics.h**.  
Inspired by the original idea, I completely rebuilt the project **from scratch** in **Godot 4**,  
bringing it into a **fully 3D world**.

# 🎮 About the Game

You play as a spearman who fights through multiple levels,  
battling enemies and improving your stats along the way.  
On each floor, you can find items that increase your **health**, **speed**, **spear length**, or **damage**.  
After defeating all enemies, the doors open, and the ultimate goal is to **defeat the boss** on the final floor.
